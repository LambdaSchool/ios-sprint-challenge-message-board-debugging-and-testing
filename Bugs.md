# Bugs


The requirements for this project are as follows:

1.  Added .resume() to Message Thread Controller's createMessageThread function.
2.  Fixed bug in MessageThreadController.  Decoder was expecting an array, but received a dictionary instead. 
3.  Fixed misspelled segue identifier in MessageThreadDetailTableViewController.
4.  Switched message decoder from array to dictionary.  Created a temp container for messages dictionary.
5.
