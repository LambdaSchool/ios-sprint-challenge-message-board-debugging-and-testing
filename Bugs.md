# Message Board Bugs

1. Can't create new thread: Write test for MessageThreadController to create thread, set breakpoint, walk through function creating thread

2. **Error decoding message threads from JSON** : Write test to fetching message threads, check model against json

3. New message send button not functioning, appears to be exiting func early due to guard, message thread might not be set - It isn't. Let's create a UITest

4. Title and subtitle not set correctly in message cells - haha, self induced error, fixed it...

5. Message threads appear in indeterminate order, writing UITest, check if message threads can be ordered somehow from dict
