found .resume() missing on line 71 and line 40 within MessageThreadController
found unnecessary semi-colons within MessageThreadController
let thread on line 52.. missing ", messages: []" within construct for use in dictionary creation..?
MessageThreadsTableViewController, line 35 had an empty threadTitleTextField being initialized
DispatchQueue.main.async missing for self.tableView.reloadData() call within createThread method
let messagesDictionaries, line 28 of MessageThread.swift had bad decode properties, missing a ":Messasge:
    - and the forKey should use .title not .message.
 MessageThreadController had a messageThreads array being emtied in the catch block of fetchMessageThreads
 messageThread variable is nil within MessageThreadDetailViewController to MessageDetailViewController, preventing Send from working', even from MessageThreadsTableViewController
      - due to most likely the array/dictionary conflict
