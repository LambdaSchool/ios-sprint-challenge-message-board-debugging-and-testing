# Release Notes
***
### We squashed some bugs today!

#### Threads:
* Sometimes your threads would show up, and sometimes they wouldn't... 

Don't worry, your threads are safely stored in the cloud! This was a visual bug only.

#### Messages:
* After writing your important messages, your thread would disappear, your message wouldn't be saved.

Your messages are being stored safely in the cloud now and you'll be magically whisked back to the thread when you tap save!

* Your View wouldn't change after you tried to save your message

You're now magically whisked back to the thread!
***
### Next Release:
We plan on improving your user experience with user messages and UI updates!

***
### Known Issues:
* All known issues affecting your experience have been fixed!
