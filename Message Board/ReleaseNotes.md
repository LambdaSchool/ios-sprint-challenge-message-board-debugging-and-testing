• fixed a bug that prevented the list of threads from loading on the screen
• addressed a syncing issue between the device and the server
• fixed an issue that caused duplicate threads to appear on the screen during certain user interactions
• enabled users to add messages to their threads
• fixed the cancel button in the add message screen
